# The Free Man's Almanac
In 1974 Leonard Read compiled _The Free Manâ€™s Almanac_, a collection of quotes from a vast array of free thinkers. 

I collected those quotations into JSON format for future use with this project. I also threw together a quick way to display today's quote. You can see this in action on [LeonardRead.org](http://leonardread.org).

## Files
- `free_mans_almanac.json` - The entire Free Man's Almanac in JSON format.
- `price_freedom.jpg` - November 26 had an image instead of a quote. This is that image.
- `index.html` - An HTML file that has jQuery that parses the JSON and javascript that actually shows today's quote.
